1) Add the following dependency in pom.xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.2</version>
</plugin>

2) Inside the directory src—>main, create a folder namely appengine. Inside appengine folder, create a file namely app.yaml. So the structure would be

Project—>src—>main—>appengine—>app.yaml(file)

3) The content of app.yaml would be 

runtime: java
env: flex

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: this field is required, but ignored

4) Now login into your GCP console and create a project where you want your Java application to be deployed.

5) Now login into gcloud SDK and set your project path by doing gcloud init command.

6) Once your gcloud SDK project is set, go to your Eclipse and build your maven project by doing mvn build command.

7) Your aap engine project SHOULD BE created in GCP console before proceeding further.Select the language for your app engine application.

8) After your project is build, go to run configurations and create a new configuration. The goals for that configuration will be

appengine:deploy -DcloudSdkPath="/Users/saurabh/Downloads/Google_Cloud_SDK/google-cloud-sdk"

Where -DcloudSdkPath would be path of gcloud SDK on your machine. You can find the path by firing the command: $(gcloud --format='value(installation.sdk_root)' info)

9) Now the system will start deploying your Java application on your GCP app engine, it may take several minutes.

10) Once done, you can find your deployed application under App Engine—>Services. It will also provide you with URL to access your application.
